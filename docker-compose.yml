# DOCKER COMPOSE — LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
# ============================================================
# This file defines all three services that make up CourtCMS
# and wires them together with a single command:
#
#   docker compose up --build
#
# Think of it as a recipe that says:
#   "I need a database, an API, and a web server.
#    Here's how to configure each one, and here's
#    how they talk to each other."
#
# After running, the app is available at:
#   Frontend:  http://localhost:4200
#   API:       http://localhost:5196
#   API Docs:  http://localhost:5196/swagger
# ============================================================

  # DATABASE: SQL Server 2022
  # --------------------------------------------------------
  # This replaces your local SQL Server installation.
  # Every developer on the team gets the exact same database
  # setup without installing anything on their machine.
  # --------------------------------------------------------
  db:
    image: mcr.microsoft.com/azure-sql-edge:latest
    container_name: courtcms-db
    environment:

      - MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=DevP@ssw0rd123! # Local dev only — never use in production
    ports:
      - '1433:1433' # Expose SQL Server on the standard port
    volumes:
      - sqldata:/var/opt/mssql # Persist data between container restarts
    healthcheck:
      # Check if SQL Server has written "ready for client connections" to its log.
      # This avoids depending on sqlcmd, which may not exist in Azure SQL Edge.
      test:
        [
          'CMD-SHELL',
          "grep -q 'ready for client connections' /var/opt/mssql/log/errorlog || exit 1",

  # BACKEND: .NET API

  # Builds from the Dockerfile in CourtCMS.Api/
  # Connects to the SQL Server container above using Docker's
  # internal DNS — the hostname "db" resolves to the database
  # container's IP address automatically.

  # FRONTEND: Angular served by Nginx

  # Builds the Angular app and serves it through Nginx.
  # Nginx also proxies /api requests to the API container.

# VOLUMES
# --------------------------------------------------------
# Named volumes persist data between container restarts.
# Without this, your database would be wiped every time
# you run 'docker compose down'.
